I want to create a repository for demonstrating utilizing chatgpt to create an AI agent that conversates. The application can continuously loop with the LLM for cognitive processing and thinking, while giving the LLM the ability to <standby> when not speaking, allowing it to continuously cognitively process and think, and <speak> when it has something to say. The <speak> action should be used like normal speech, it is used to talk in a real conversation. The cognitive processing and thinking uses vector embeddings to store context and knowledge for the LLM to use. The main loop continuously dynamically updates the context and knowledge for the LLM as it is listening to the conversation.
